I'm a PhD student at Queen Mary University of London under the supervision of [Paulo Rauber](https://www.paulorauber.com/). My research focuses on developing reinforcement learning algorithms that are both scalable and sample-efficient, with a particular emphasis on Large Language Models, Bayesian methods, and model-based approaches. In addition to my academic work, I have also worked as an AI Developer at [xDNA](https://xdna.nl/), working on tools using Generative AI that optimize the workflow of professional fact-checkers [Project Aletheia](https://gulbenkian.pt/emifund/projects/aletheia/).
