I'm a PhD student at Queen Mary University of London under the supervision of [Paulo Rauber](https://www.paulorauber.com/).  My research aims to develop principled reinforcement learning algorithms that are both scalable and sample efficient. This research is specifically centered around Bayesian (and) model-based reinforcement learning algorithm. I also work as a research scientist at [xDNA](https://xdna.nl/) with a focus on both Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision.
