I'm a PhD student at Queen Mary University of London under the supervision of (Paulo Rauber)(https://www.paulorauber.com/).  My research aims to develop principled reinforcement learning algorithms that are both scalable and sample efficient. This research is specifically centered around Bayesian (and) model-based reinforcement learning algorithm.
