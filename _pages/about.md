I'm a PhD student at Queen Mary University of London under the supervision of [Paulo Rauber](https://www.paulorauber.com/). My research focuses on developing reinforcement learning algorithms that are both scalable and sample-efficient, with a particular emphasis on Bayesian and model-based approaches. I also work as a research scientist at [xDNA](https://xdna.nl/), where I focus on the development of both Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision applications.
